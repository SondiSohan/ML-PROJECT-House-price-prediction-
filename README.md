# ML-PROJECT-House-price-prediction-
This project utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression, to predict house prices per unit area. The predictive model considers various factors such as property age, proximity to amenities like MRT stations and convenience stores, and geographical location. The web application, built using Dash, allows users to input property details and receive accurate price predictions, aiding buyers, sellers, and investors in making informed decisions in the real estate market.
